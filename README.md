# City Path Finder

I was tasked to creat city_map.cpp which can be found in src/. I was given city_map_base.cpp, and had to build my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
to work in tangent with it.

#### Usage:
```bash
./bin/city_map none|best|worst|avg time|print|jgraph - map on standard input
```
#### Example:
```bash
./bin/city_map best time < maps/city-1.txt
```
